- development to production
- nginx (security and high performance connection handling mechanism) --> reverse proxy to Gunicorn

# gunicorn installation
- create a virtual environment
- pip install django gunicorn psycopg2-binary

############################################
-sudo apt-get install gunicorn nginx

- gunicorn to load the project's WSGI module
- gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi
- gunicorn socket will listen for connections

nginx

-Test your Nginx configuration for syntax errors by typing:
- sudo nginx -t

If no errors are reported, go ahead and restart Nginx by typing:
- sudo systemctl restart nginx

Finally, we need to open up our firewall to normal traffic on port 80. Since we no longer need access to the development server, we can remove the rule to open port 8000 as well:
- sudo ufw delete allow 8000
- sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

securing traffic to the server using SSL/TLS

Check the Nginx process logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u nginx
Check the Nginx access logs by typing: sudo less /var/log/nginx/access.log
Check the Nginx error logs by typing: sudo less /var/log/nginx/error.log
Check the Gunicorn application logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u gunicorn
Check the Gunicorn socket logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u gunicorn.socket

If you update your Django application, you can restart the Gunicorn process to pick up the changes by typing:

sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
If you change Gunicorn socket or service files, reload the daemon and restart the process by typing:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn.socket gunicorn.service
If you change the Nginx server block configuration, test the configuration and then Nginx by typing:

sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
These commands are helpful for picking up changes as you adjust your configuration.

Test Gunicorn: Start Gunicorn and test that it is working by running the command 
`gunicorn myproject.wsgi`

Configure Gunicorn: Create a configuration file for Gunicorn to specify the number of worker processes and other settings. 
Here is an example configuration file:

bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"
workers = 3
errorlog = '/var/log/gunicorn/error.log'
accesslog = '/var/log/gunicorn/access.log'


Configure Nginx: Create a configuration file for Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for Gunicorn.
Here is an example configuration file:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

Step 7: Restart Nginx and Gunicorn

To apply the changes, restart Nginx and Gunicorn by running the following commands:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

Step 1: Install Gunicorn and Nginx on your server

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian, you can use the following command to install Gunicorn and Nginx:

csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install gunicorn nginx
If you are using CentOS or RHEL, you can use the following command:

sql
Copy code
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install nginx
sudo yum install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install gunicorn
Step 2: Create a virtual environment

To create a virtual environment using virtualenv, run the following command:

Copy code
virtualenv myenv
To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Django and other dependencies

To install Django and other dependencies required by your project, activate your virtual environment and run the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Test Gunicorn

To start Gunicorn, navigate to your Django project's root directory and run the following command:

Copy code
gunicorn myproject.wsgi
This should start Gunicorn, and you should be able to access your Django application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Step 5: Configure Gunicorn

To configure Gunicorn, create a configuration file in your Django project's root directory, for example gunicorn_config.py. Here is an example configuration file:

makefile
Copy code
bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"
workers = 3
errorlog = '/var/log/gunicorn/error.log'
accesslog = '/var/log/gunicorn/access.log'
This configuration file specifies that Gunicorn should bind to 127.0.0.1:8000, use three worker processes, and write error and access logs to /var/log/gunicorn/error.log and /var/log/gunicorn/access.log respectively.

Step 6: Configure Nginx

To configure Nginx, create a new configuration file in the /etc/nginx/sites-available/ directory. You can name the file whatever you want, for example myproject. Here is an example configuration file:

perl
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
This configuration file specifies that Nginx should listen on port 80, use example.com as the server name, and proxy requests to http://127.0.0.1:8000 where Gunicorn is running.

To enable the new configuration file, create a symbolic link in the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ directory:

bash
Copy code
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Step 7: Restart Nginx and Gunicorn

To apply the changes, restart Nginx and Gunicorn by running the following commands:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
Now your Django project should be accessible via Nginx, 
and Gunicorn should be serving the Django application. 
You can test it by visiting your server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.
