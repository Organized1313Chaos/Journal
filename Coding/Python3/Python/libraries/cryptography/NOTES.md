- **Symmetric Encryption**
  - single shared key
  - `Ex. AES, Blowfish, ChaCha20`
- **Asymmetric Encryption**
  - secure communication between two parties 
  - public key for encryption, private key for decryption
- **Hashing** 
  - `Exa. SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512`
- **Signing and Verifying**
  - digital signature algorithms
  - `RSA-PSS, RSA-PKCS1v15`
  - signed with private key and verified with public key
